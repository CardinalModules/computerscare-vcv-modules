Draws a stick figure

Tips:
- Use a polyphonic signal to get the most variety
- Turn the weird looking "scramble" knob to shuffle the input channels prior to drawing
- For a "floating through space" look: use a slow LFO sine wave
- To make the little guy dance, try a square wave or sawtooth wave LFO, or an envelope
- For full seizure mode: patch in an audio signal
